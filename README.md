# SplitFolder [in dev]
Storing a great many files (e.g., 10,000 files or above) in a single folder can slow down computer performance dramatically in many respects
(e.g., file indexing) and can be risky. SplitFolder addresses this issue by creating dividing an input folder into subfolders.

## Required data
    A folder containing one or more files
## Output data
    Subfolders of the input folder.
    A log file containing user arguments and processing information.
