## SplitFolder [Development]
Storing a great many files (e.g., 10,000 files or above) in a single folder can slow down computer performance dramatically in many respects
(e.g., file indexing) and can be risky. SplitFolder addresses this issue by creating dividing an input folder into subfolders.

### Required data

### Output data
    Subfolders of the input folder.
    A log file containing user arguments and processing information.
